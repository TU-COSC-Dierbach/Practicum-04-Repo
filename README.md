## Practicum 4 - Keywords in Java

**BACKGROUND**<br>
A `keyword` (or `reserved word`) in a programming language is an
identifier defined within the programming language itself, 
and therefore not available for the programmer to use for
their own identifier naming. The current list of keywords in
Java can be found here: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/_keywords.html

In Java, all keywords contain all lower-case characters. Since
Java is case sensitive, programmer-defined identifiers containing
at least one upper-case character can be assumed NOT to be a
Java keyword.

**WHAT TO DO**<br>
Make the keyword-related changes needed for the program to correctly execute.
